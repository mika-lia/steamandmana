What is Steam and Mana?

 

The goal with the modpack is to create a world in which steampunk-like technology is evolving and taking the place of the once dominant magical schools and teachings. Be a wizard with Mana and Artifice and Ars Noveau, a Hemomancer with Blood magic and Evilcraft, a Druid with Botania and Roots, a Soul manipulator with Malum and Spirit, a Theurgist with Occultism and Eidolon or be one of the innovators and start your journey in engineering.

 

You will be able to experience the best magic mods 1.18.2 has to offer while also playing with Create and all of it's incredible addons including Valkyrien Skies: Eureka! Your creativity is the only limit. 

 

How is it played?

 

This is a semi-kitchen-sink pack, with all mods available from the get go but getting slightly harder as you progress. Right now the pack is in beta and the questbook is in progress but fully playable with all the balance changes that you would expect! Once finished the pack should contain questlines and custom recipes for every major mod. Starting with Create. 

 

I'm currently looking for potential partners to test play and maybe help with the development of the pack. We have a dedicated server online and are building a community, come join us!
